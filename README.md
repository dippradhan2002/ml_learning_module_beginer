# BNG House Rate Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting house rates in Bangalore using machine learning.

## Project Overview

The project aims to predict house prices in Bangalore based on various features. This involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation

To run the notebook and the accompanying code, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/BNG_house_rate.git
    cd BNG_house_rate
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook BNG_house_rate.ipynb
    ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.
